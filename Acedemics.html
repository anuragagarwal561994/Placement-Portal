                        <p>DA-IICT is a forerunner in the field of ICT. This fundamental innovation, combining Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) and Computer Sciences and Engineering (CSE), was embedded in the large matrix of interdisciplinary subjects including Design, Science and Management, Film and Animation along with the traditional Humanities and Social Sciences. This vision, we are proud to say, is an amalgamation of Liberal Arts and an engineering institute. It visualizes the student as a professional and as a citizen dealing with knowledge systems at large but with core competence in ICT. The curriculum designed by eminent faculty very well exemplifies the convergence of skills required by ICT. Research and Development is the most important component of the education system, which puts the institute at par with many other reputed institutes in the world. Projects, which are aimed at providing practical knowledge and experience, form an integral component of the education system. The curriculum is designed to produce competent and confident professionals with knowledge and expertise to meet the needs of the present and the future world.</p>

                        <p>The B.Tech (Honours in ICT with minor in Computational Science) has been recently started at DA-IICT to impart the necessary knowledge and insight to the students to build computational models to understand, analyze and address fundamental problems in the areas of societal importance. Computational science involves use of advanced computing capabilities and IT knowledge to understand and solve complex science, engineering and social problems aimed in improving products, processes, and work-flows.</p>
                        <p>The program is focused on two main lines – theoretical learning and practical implementation. The minor in CS provides an opportunity to pursue a focused set of courses (core and electives) that emphasize all aspects of Computational Science. The minor requires extra 30 credits in addition to what an ICT undergraduate takes and the students must take 6 core courses in the areas of Mathematics, Physics, Numerical and Computational Methods, Modeling and Simulation, High Performance Computing, Parallel Programming, Data analysis and Visualization. The electives are further designed to sharpen thisskill-set by providing domain knowledge in interdisciplinary areas ranging from engineering to biological applications.</p>
